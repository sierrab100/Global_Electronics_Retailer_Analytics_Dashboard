# Global Electronics Retailer Sales Analysis (Excel Project)

## Objective:
The goal of this project was to analyze historical sales data from a global electronics retailer to uncover trends, identify performance patterns, and highlight areas of growth and decline across product categories and store types.

Tools Used:

- Microsoft Excel

- Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts

- Data Cleaning and Formatting

- Trend Analysis and Visualization

## Process:
The dataset was first cleaned and prepared for analysis by handling missing values, standardizing category names, and ensuring date consistency. Pivot Tables were then created to analyze revenue by year, month, category, and store type. Pivot Charts were used to visualize trends and make year-over-year comparisons more intuitive.

## Results:



## Key Insights:

**Revenue Trends:** Overall revenue showed a steady increase year over year until 2020, when there was a noticeable drop, likely linked to external market factors.

**Seasonal Patterns:** Significant revenue dips consistently occurred in April each year, suggesting a recurring seasonal slowdown in sales.

**Category Performance:** The Computers category generated the highest revenue across all years. While early on, the gap between Computers and the next top category was small, this gap has steadily widened, indicating growing dominance in that category.

**Store Type Analysis:** The online store consistently outperformed physical store locations, bringing in significantly more revenue.

**Sales Growth by Category:** Computers showed the greatest increase in sales up until 2019, reinforcing the categoryâ€™s strong upward momentum prior to the 2020 revenue decline.
